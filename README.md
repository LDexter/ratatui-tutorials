# Ratatui Tutorials
### My manual progression through the Ratatui library for TUI development in Rust

You will find comments throughout which I added for even more clarity than the original tutorial projects. Most comments were made as I followed along, some will be retroactive additions. All comments are to help guide my understanding of the library and Rust as a whole.

[Ratatui's original tutorials](https://ratatui.rs/tutorials) helped me a great deal, and are some of the best guidance for a library I've seen yet!
